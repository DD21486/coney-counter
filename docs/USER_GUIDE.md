# Coney Verification System - User Guide

## What is the Coney Verification System?

The Coney Verification System automatically reads your receipt and fills in your coney log for you! Just take a photo of your receipt and we'll extract all the important information like how many coneys you had, which restaurant, and when you visited.

2. **On your phone**: Your camera will open automatically

### Step 3: Wait for Processing
- You'll see a progress indicator showing "Processing receipt..."

- The system is reading all the text from your receipt

### Step 4: Review Extracted Data

- Check that the brand and quantity look correct

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is it taking so long to process?
A: The first time you use it, the system needs to download language models (about 10-20MB). After that, processing is much faster (10-30 seconds).

### Q: Can I use this on any receipt?
A: It works best with printed receipts from Cincinnati chili restaurants. Handwritten or damaged receipts may not work as well.

### Q: What if the system gets something wrong?
A: You can always edit the form before submitting, or switch back to manual entry. The system is designed to help, not replace your judgment.

### Q: Will this work offline?
A: The OCR processing happens on your device, so it works without internet. However, you'll need internet to submit the log to our servers.

### Q: Can I upload multiple receipts at once?
A: Currently, you can only process one receipt at a time. This helps ensure accuracy and prevents confusion.

### Q: What if I don't have a receipt?
A: No problem! Just use manual entry to log your coneys the traditional way.
